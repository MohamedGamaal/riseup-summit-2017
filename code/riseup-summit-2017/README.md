## Scala Examples

Make sure you have a valid [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org) installation for your platform. To run the examples, first compile the code:

```
sbt
compile
```

And then, to run a specific example, say `com.elmenus.riseup2017.e008.E008ImplicitTreeApp`:

```
runMain com.elmenus.riseup2017.e008.E008ImplicitTreeApp
```

Some examples require some services like `postgres` or `mongo`, this should be created for you when you follow the instructions under `deploy` directory
